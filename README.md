# Vista Basic

Vista Basic is a complete Application Development Framework for building web
applications to run on PHP servers.

Vista Basic's language is modelled after Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) with a simple familiar syntax. No knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is required to use the framework.

There is a built-in VB editor included (based on Microsoft's Monaco editor) and you can use any VBA-compatible editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc) on the desktop for code editing.

This framework uses:
-- Qooxdoo for the UI (https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo)
-- CodeIgiter for the server https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter

The code is under active development.

Please see my blog for more information:

# Server Requirements

The same as CodeIgniter (see above).

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

The "session" directory must be writeable by the web server.
